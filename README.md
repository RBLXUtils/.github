Not to be confused with [sleitnick's RbxUtil,](https://github.com/Sleitnick/RbxUtil) which was created shortly after, which may cause confusion.

This was a project maintained by [LucasMZ.](https://github.com/lucasmz-dev) It consisted of utilities and concepts of them, to help with development. It is no longer maintained. If you want this user or org name, let me know and I will transfer it to you.

Its main work ended up being FastSignal. A Signal library that had different visions than ones like GoodSignal in order to provide another option and vision to the community. It is still a nice option that provides Deferred support and automatically adjusts to the needs of your game.

It was abandoned because of toxic behavior by the community such as ableism I noticed, and other personal issues, therefore any development relating to Roblox stopped. My current decision to stick with Linux, a now banned platform from Roblox, also makes this project inviable to support in the future.
